# Welcome

Welcome to the website accompanying the course [Integrated Energy Grids course](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2025-2026/46770?menulanguage=en) in the Spring Semester 2026. This course has been developed by [Assoc. Prof. Marta Victoria](https://martavictoria.org) and offered at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/). This semester it is taught by [Aleksander Grochowicz](https://aleks-g.github.io) and [Parisa Rahdan](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/parisa-rahdan/). 

On this website, you will find tutorials for different topics covered in the course, as well as detailed solutions for some of the problems proposed in the course. We use Python and packages such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `networkx`, and `pypsa` in this course and provide practical introductions to those packages. 

The topics covered in the problems include:

- Time series analysis applied to wind and solar generation
- Optimisation problems and interpretation of KKT/Lagrange multipliers
- Optimal economic dispatch
- Incidence matrix representing a network topology and susceptance matrix
- Optimal power flow and linearised optimal power flow
- Gas networks
- Heat networks
- Capacity and dispatch optimisation in a single node and a network
- Multi-carrier energy systems integration
